## Accessing Guacamole

[Guacamole](http://bit.ly/2dzB3b6) is an HTML5 web application that provides access to desktop environments using remote desktop protocols (such as VNC or RDP). **As long as you have access to a web browser, you have access to your machines.**

Navigate to the login `${URI}` and login with the your user/password, both should be provided to you by your instructor.

![Guacamole Login]({{ "/images/guac_login.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

After logging in, you should see two groups, `term` and `vnc`.

![Guacamole Welcome]({{ "/images/guac_welc.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Before clicking on the user's name under the `vnc` group, navigate to the user's settings page.

![Guacamole Settings]({{ "/images/guac_setti.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

And, select the "Text input" button under the **Default Input Method** section.

![Guacamole Settings]({{ "/images/guac_input.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Return **Home** via the same drop down used to reach the settings page.

Finally, click your user's name under the `vnc` group.
